ModBot V 2.0.0

ModBot is a modular IRC bot written in Python (2.7).
It is built with ease of use in mind - whether that use be from the end user, someone writing a plugin, or someone editing existing parts of the bot.

The main class in modbot.py provides the most basic of functions (loading plugins and running hooks), while plugins provide all other end-user functionality.

Modbot currently takes 3 arguments - channel (without leading '#'), nickname and nickserv password

E.g.

python2 modbot.py chaostheory ModBot modbotisawesome

Would connect to the channel '#chaostheory', with the nickname 'ModBot', and identify with nickServ (if your specified nick is registered).
I only just realised that modbot currently only connects to irc.rizon.net >_>
TODO: - Add 'network' parameter.
