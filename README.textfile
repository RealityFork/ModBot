ModBot V 2.0.0

ModBot is a modular IRC bot written in Python (2.7).
It is built with ease of use in mind - whether that use be from the end user, someone writing a plugin, or someone editing existing parts of the bot.

The main class in modbot.py provides the most basic of functions (loading plugins and running hooks), while plugins provide all other end-user functionality.

Modbot currently takes 4 arguments - network, channel (without leading '#'), nickname and nickserv password (optional).

E.g.

<pre><code>
python2 modbot.py irc.rizon.net channel ModBot modbotisawesome
</code></pre>

Would connect to the channel '#channel', with the nickname 'ModBot', and identify with nickServ (if your specified nick is registered).
