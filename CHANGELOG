-- Changelog --

V2.0.0:
- Added command, hook and dependancy registering.
	- Modules define which other modules they depend on, and are not loaded unless all dependancies are met.
	- Commands that the module responds to are also registered with modbot, along with the methods that should be called.
	- Hooks like userJoin, userPart are registed in the same way that commands are.

- Added separate 'helper' MySQL module.
	- Provides functions for finding and editing rows in DB tables instead of seperate implimentations in seperate modules.
	- Has config file 'mysqlconfig.py' to specify database name, user etc. Modules can edit any tables inside the database specified here.

- Seperated Omegle module classes.
	- Supplies an Omegle helper module that can be used with other modules if desired.

- Added separate 'helper' Twitter module.

- Added GPL to modbot and all packaged plugins.

- Modbot now asks for a NickServ password rather than having to pass it as a parameter.
