ModBot V 2.0.1

ModBot is a modular IRC bot written in Python (2.7).
It is built with ease of use in mind - whether that use be from the end user, someone writing a plugin, or someone editing existing parts of the bot.

The main class in modbot.py provides the most basic of functions (loading plugins and running hooks), while plugins provide all other end-user functionality.

To configure Modbot:

1: Copy/move settings.conf.default to settings.conf and configure to your liking.
2: Go to the modules folder and do the same for any module configs that you wish to use.
3: Edit startup.py to contain all of the modules you want to be loaded on startup.

Then you are able to run Modbot:
<pre><code>
python2 modbot.py
</code></pre>

Modbot will then ask for a NickServ password to identify with.
