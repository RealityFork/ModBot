ModBot V 2.0.0

ModBot is a modular IRC bot written in Python (2.7).
It is built with ease of use in mind - whether that use be from the end user, someone writing a plugin, or someone editing existing parts of the bot.

The main class in modbot.py provides the most basic of functions (loading plugins and running hooks), while plugins provide all other end-user functionality.

Modbot currently takes 3 arguments - network, channel (without leading '#') and nickname.
I am looking at providing a settings file that will remove the need for these parameters as well as add some more features.

E.g.

<pre><code>
python2 modbot.py irc.ircserver.net channel ModBot
</code></pre>

Would connect to 'ircserver' and join the channel '#channel', with the nickname 'ModBot'.
Modbot will then ask for a NickServ password to identify with.
